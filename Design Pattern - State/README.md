A state pattern is a pattern in which the objects's behaviour is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transition). A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine. Classic state pattern is a classic state pattern implementation that uses pointer and transition function while handmade state pattern uses map and rules.
